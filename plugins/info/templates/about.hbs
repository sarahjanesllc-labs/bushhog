        <p class="lead">
            Our market was created to provide fresh locally grown produce and
            to help educate the community on healthier eating habits through
            meal ideas, cooking technique classes, and guidance on growing produce
            in your own back yards. We also exist to provide produce packages
            to those in need, work with local non-profit kitchens, and food
            distribution sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is our passion to improve quality of life through healthy eating,
            provide an alternate source for quality produce at equal and more times
            than not lower prices than chain grocery stores.
